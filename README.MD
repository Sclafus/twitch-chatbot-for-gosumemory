# THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MANTAINED. PLEASE USE [MIRAYA](https://github.com/MirayaProject/miraya)
A basic and lightweight Twitch chatbot to use with [gosumemory](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory)!

# Features
`!np` responds in chat with the currently playing map and a URL for the download link

`!skin` responds in chat with the skin currently in use with a URL to download it. The message is dinamically generated. New skins are automatically uploaded to [mega.nz](https://mega.nz). The URLs are automatically shortened using [tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com/)

# Installation

## Step 1: download
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Sclafus/twitch-chatbot-for-gosumemory/releases/latest) for your operating system (Windows builds are tested under Wine, keep that in mind)

## Step 2: create a new twitch app
- Login on [Twitch Developers](https://dev.twitch.tv/)
- Register a [new Twitch Application](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps). Choose a name (eg. "Osu Chatbot") and set your URL to `https://127.0.0.1`. The category should be "Chat Bot".
- Copy the `Client ID`, it will be needed in [Step 3](#step-3-create-config)

- Open your browser in incognito mode and visit [twitchapps](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) to get your oauth token. You will need to login with your bot account, not your main account.
- Copy the oauth token

## Step 3: create config
- Create a `config.txt` file with the following content:

```bash
# Twitch config
TMI_TOKEN = ####################               # starts with "oauth:"
CLIENT_ID = ##################
BOT_NICK = your_chatbot_username
BOT_PREFIX = !
CHANNEL = your_channel_username
GOSUMEMORY_JSON_URL = http://127.0.0.1:24050/json # probably this

# Mega config
MEGA_EMAIL = example@email.com
MEGA_PASSWORD = yourpassword                   # not very secure, I know...
                                               # also 2FA is not supported
MEGA_FOLDER = folder/subfolder
```
## Step 4: play more
- Open your executable and enjoy

# Development Installation

## Step 1
- Follow [Step 2](#step-2-create-a-new-twitch-app) and [step 3](#step-3-create-config)
## Step 2: clone the repository, install python and dependencies 
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and add it to PATH

- Clone the repository - [Download zip](https://github.com/Sclafus/twitch-chatbot-for-gosumemory/archive/refs/heads/senpai.zip)

- Open a terminal and type:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install the required libraries


## Step 3: play more
- Execute `python twitch_chatbot.py` in the terminal or simply double click it

# Known Issues
- `!skin` makes the bot unresponsive to further commands. This will be solved as soon as multithreading is introduced.
- Quite slow upload speed. This does not depend on me, sorry guys
